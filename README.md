# Cineticket_PythonProject
The CINETICKET Movie Booking System project is developed exclusively using Python, Tkinter, and MySQL. We have seamlessly incorporated TkinterVideo and pip modules into this application to enhance its functionality and user experience.

The project begins with our custom CINETICKET logo animation, leading to the Login Page. Here, users can log in by entering their account credentials. For those without an existing account, a Sign-Up Page is available, allowing new users to register quickly and easily.

Once logged in, users are directed to the Main Screen, where they can explore the movies available for booking. From here, they can either select from the featured films or navigate to the Movies page, which presents a curated list of ten movies, categorized into English and Hindi films.

Clicking on any movie displays its detailed description and an option to book tickets. Upon selecting the Book Tickets button, users are prompted to provide essential details, including their name, phone number, the number of tickets required, and the preferred date for the show.

The system automatically calculates the total price and generates a receipt containing all booking details, ensuring a seamless and hassle-free process.
